# Senior Project
This is the project I made in senior project class. It's purpose is not to advertise for both Adidas and Kairos. 


## Kairos
It utilizes the API from "Kairos", which provides lots of functions such as face detection, face recognition, and age detection, etc. This recaptcha uses face detection mostly, but as it's developing, other function such as face recognition can be utilized too. 

The easiest way to get started is to add your APP_ID and API_KEY after signing up at [developer.kairos.com](https://developer.kairos.com) 



## Adidas
When purchasing sneakers on Adidas website, especially Yeezy Boost, bots always beat humans. Now, the "Recaptcha" system can be broke by bots easily. By using this API, it forces people to take a picture in front of the computer to identify the human identity, which bots can't do unless it has a face just like human.


## Webpage
I used Adidas' webpage in the demonstration. Once the facial recognition technology gets mature enough, it can be used in most of the online shopping websites, such as Amazon, eBay, etc. 


## Further development
The API now uses the webcam to take a picture and detect if there's a face in the picture. In the further development, it can let customer to create an account, and binds their face to that account. When checking out, it has to recognize it's your face in order to check out, which is far more convenient than typing your long, long password.
